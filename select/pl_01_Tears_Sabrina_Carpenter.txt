Mm
Mm, mm
Uh
I get wet at the thought of you
(Uh-huh)
Being a responsible guy
Treating me like
you're supposed to do
(Uh-huh)
Tears run down my thighs
A little initiative
can go a very long, long way
Baby, just do the dishes,
I'll give you
(What you, what you,
what you want)
A little communication,
yes, that's my ideal foreplay
Assemble a chair from IKEA,
I'm like, "Uh" (Uh)
I get wet at the thought of you
(Uh-huh)
Being a responsible guy
(So responsible)
Treating me like
you're supposed to do
(Uh-huh)
Tears run down my thighs
A little respect for
women can get you very,
very far
Remembering how to use
your phone gets me
(Oh so, oh so, oh so hot)
Considering I have feelings,
I'm like,
"Why are my clothes still on?"
Offering to do anything,
I'm like, "Oh my God"
I get wet at the thought of you
(Uh-huh)
Being a responsible guy
(So responsible)
Treating me like
you're supposed to do
(Uh-huh)
Tears run down my thighs
I get wet at the thought of you
Being a responsible guy
Treating me like
you're supposed to do
Tears run down my thighs
Dance break
So responsible
Oh
I get wet at the thought of you
(Uh-huh)
Being a responsible guy
(So responsible)
Treating me like
you're supposed to do
(Uh-huh)
Tears run down my thighs
